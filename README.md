# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This website is just a silly comparison between nerds and rockstars, mostly from the 80's
and will provide little other value save maybe a smile!

Ultimately my goal was to meet the project0 requirements by exploring the various tools
and techniques we learnt throughout the first two lectures, while also just having a little fun with it.

Below is a summary of files and functions:

styles.css -- contains some basic css styling for various elements on the site, including
some !important statements as well as @media statements

variables.scss, variables.css -- all I did was play with some color and size code based
off the course material but was able to execute successfully.

index.html -- contains the majority of the code requirements beyond those in the css file including two column use of bootstrap grid model, bootstrap nav, and images.

nerds.html, rockstars.html -- both include all the header and footer code from the index.thml and then a table as the main content.

summary.html -- this file also includes the header and footer code copied from the index.html page and a couple simple statements to conclude a series of page views.
